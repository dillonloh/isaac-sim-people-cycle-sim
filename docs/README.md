# Omni.Anim.People (BETA)

Omni.Anim.People is an extension for simulating human events in environments such as retail stores, warehouses, office buildings, traffic intersections etc. A simulation consists of a sequence of actions for each character in the scene to perform. The character actions currently supported are - idle, look around, sit, stand, walk, and queue. The extension consists of a UI to configure simulation settings, behavior scripts that control the characters in a simulation, and pre-configured character assets and animations that can be readily used.
